My idea for the game is a platform quiz solve with hidden trap and chasing monster AI.
Most of the game is inspired by Maplestory mobs and character

Basically the player has to understand the hint and follow it because the trigger to next level is hidden somewhere in the scene.

In this project I use basic physical controlling with 4 directional key and space bar

Right click is used to show the hint for each level

The game is Created for Window platform with Unity 2019.1.4f1 (64-bit)
